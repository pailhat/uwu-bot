# uwu-bot
A discord.js bot for a League of Legends Discord server that plays music, tells jokes, and generates random teams from people in your voice call for playing custom LoL matches.

If you want to set uwu-bot up locally, install node.js, clone the repository, and in the highest directory (same directory where your index.js file is), add a file called ".env" which will have your discord token and youtube key. 

The contents of .env should look like the following:

```
DISCORD_TOKEN=PUT_YOUR_DISCORD_TOKEN_HERE
YT_KEY=PUT_YOUR_YOUTUBE_KEY_HERE
```

Here's the available commands and some screenshots.

Play songs from youtube (link or a search term). You can also skip songs or just tell the bot to stop playing music:
